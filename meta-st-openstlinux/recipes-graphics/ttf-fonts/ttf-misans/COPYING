MIUI SYSTEM FONT MiSans
In order to better serve information experience design on multiple devices, we collaborate with Hanyi Fonts to develop the new typeface for the MIUI system - MiSans. MIUI attaches great importance to how typeface works in the system design. Due to MiSans having flat but powerful strokes and sourcing from pithy design ideas, it is more suitable for device displays. MiSans have further details on Chinese characters, English Characters, and numbers compares to Xiaomi Lanting. Moreover, MiSans developed more Opentype Features, to help designers define exquisite layout and create clear and legible designs in many different sizes and contexts. Since December 28th, 2021, MiSans is announced to be available to download for free with no restricted conditions.
